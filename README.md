> *A strong woman, an adventurer, a mother, a traveller, an appreciator of humanities, a lover of knowledge. I started a career in design 10+ years ago and I’ve been creating every since. My career heights are in Creative Direction and Branding, but I decided on a new direction after managing tech projects from the frontend and realizing it’s an outlet with better job stability. There is also a shift happening that is encouraging to women. I returned to London to study software development as it’s the first place I came to study art & felt inspired. Object oriented design feels like a natural progression and a new set of tools enabling me broader opportunities.*
